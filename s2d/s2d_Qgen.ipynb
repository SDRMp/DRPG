    "    You are an AI Expert. You are provided with partial information along with the top-3 categories where this information could belong. Each category also has a list of keywords that represent the characteristic content covered by the category. Your task is to ask an information-seeking question based on the partial information and the category keywords such that when answered, one of the categories can be selected with confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Follow the following thinking strategy:\n",
    "    First, eliminate the categories that are not probable based on the given information. Identify the main context of the partial information and see if similar content matches any of the keywords in a category. If it doesn't, then the category can be taken out of consideration.\n",
    "    Now generate a question. This question should further probe for information that will help refine the identification of the most likely category. Your question should strategically use the keywords tied to each potential category, aiming to effectively differentiate between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Strictly follow the format shown in examples for output generation. Double quote the final question.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here are a few examples to understand better:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 1:\n",
    "    Partial information: \"I constantly sneeze and have a dry cough.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Category: Allergy, Keywords: {headache, coughing, wet, sneeze, pain}\n",
    "    Category: Diabetes, Keywords: {severe, feet, skin, rashes, infection}\n",
    "    Category: Common Cold, Keywords: {swollen, cough, body, shivery, ache, dry}\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note:\n",
    "    Sneeze and dry cough are the main subjects of the partial information. Coughing is present in Allergy and common cold, but cough or sneeze is not present in Diabetes. Therefore, Diabetes can't be a possible label. Only two labels—Allergy and Common Cold—are considered. The keywords suggest that knowing about symptoms like headache, body pain, shivery, etc., will help refine the classification into one of the labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Therefore only two labels, namely:\n",
    "    Category: Allergy\n",
    "    Category: Common Cold\n",
    "    are used to form a question.\n",
    "\n",
    "    QUESTION: \"Besides fever, are you experiencing symptoms such as cough, severe headaches, localized pain, or inflammation? Also, can you describe the pattern of your fever—is it continuous or does it occur in intervals?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 2:\n",
    "    Partial information: \"The software keeps crashing.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Category: Software Bug, Keywords: {crash, error, bug, glitch}\n",
    "    Category: User Error, Keywords: {instructions, setup, incorrect, usage}\n",
    "    Category: Hardware Issue, Keywords: {overheating, components, failure, malfunction}\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note:\n",
    "    The main subject of the partial information is the software crash. The keyword 'crash' is directly related to Software Bug but could also be indirectly related to User Error and Hardware Issue. However, to differentiate, asking about the conditions under which the crash happens or if any error messages appear could help narrow down the correct category.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Therefore, all three categories, namely:\n",
    "    Category: Software Bug\n",
    "    Category: User Error\n",
    "    Category: Hardware Issue\n",
    "    are used to form a question.\n",
    "\n",
    "    QUESTION: \"When the software crashes, do you receive any specific error messages, or does it happen during particular tasks? Have you noticed any hardware malfunctions or overheating before the crashes?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 3:\n",
    "    Partial information: \"The car is making a strange noise.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Category: Engine Problem, Keywords: {noise, misfire, engine, smoke}\n",
    "    Category: Tire Issue, Keywords: {flat, noise, pressure, alignment}\n",
    "    Category: Transmission Issue, Keywords: {shifting, noise, gears, slipping}\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note:\n",
    "    The main subject of the partial information is the strange noise. The keyword 'noise' is present in all three categories—Engine Problem, Tire Issue, Transmission Issue. Knowing more about the type of noise and when it occurs can help identify the correct category.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Therefore, all three categories, namely:\n",
    "    Category: Engine Problem\n",
    "    Category: Tire Issue\n",
    "    Category: Transmission Issue\n",
    "    are used to form a question.\n",
    "\n",
    "    QUESTION: \"Can you describe the noise in more detail? Is it a grinding, squealing, or clicking sound? Does it happen while driving, when shifting gears, or when the car is stationary?\"\n",
    "\n",
